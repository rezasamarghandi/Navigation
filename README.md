Simulink Navigation Block Based On WGS-84

It gets Vehicles velocity along x-y-z axis (u, v, w) in (m/s) and angular velocities (p, q, r) in (rad/s) and Roll, Pitch, Psi Angles in (rad) And Returns the Longitude, Latitude And Altitude Coordinates Of The Vehicle. 


It's Especially Good For Simulations Of Any Vehicles (Aircrafts, ...) and use the outputs in Simulation Softwares.


All you need to do is to give the Initial Longitude and Latitude in (Degree-Minutes-Seconds) order and Initial Altitude in meter.
